# Stacks
##stacks is a data structure used in c to store data in a particular linear order. it either follows first in, last out(FIFO) or last in, first out(LIFO) order. It uses 'push' operation to insert/enter an element, and 'pop' operation to delete/remove an element.
If the stack is full then the condition is said to be overflow and if it's empty then the condition is underflow
